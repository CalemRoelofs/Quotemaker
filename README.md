# QuoteMaker - Markov chain quote generator

## Brief
This is a simple quote generator made using Markov chains.  
The model is trained of a dataset provided by http://thewebminer.com so most of the credit goes to them.  
Background images are retrieved from Unsplash but the program could easily be adapted to load iamges locally.

virtualenv venv  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  
```
